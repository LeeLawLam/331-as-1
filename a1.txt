4a. How many distinct keys, keys which each produce different ciphertexts for the same message, do each of the three ciphers have? 
Note: 
1. Only replace the "___" with your answer.
2. Any other change in the template might result in a potential mark deduction.

Original caesar cipher
  Answer: 25 (Number)
  Explanation: each letter defines a unique shift amount (10-20 words)

Problem 1 implementation
  Answer: 25 (Number)
  Explanation: functionally identical to the original Caesar cipher (10-20 words)

Problem 2 implementation
  Answer: 25 (Number)
  Explanation: only the initial key is secret; subsequent shifts are deterministic (10-20 words)

4b. Is the problem 2 cipher stronger than the original Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: it reduces frequency leakage but does not increase key space (10-20 words)

4c. Will encrypting the space help address the weaknesses of the Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: encrypting spaces hides word boundaries (10-20 words)
